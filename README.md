This project serves as an example for writing Automation using [Gauge](http://getgauge.io)

This project uses 

- [Capypage](https://github.com/TWChennai/capypage), that gives you neat helpers to define your Page Objects.
- Capybara, as a dependency of Capypage
- Test::Unit for assertions
- Snap CI has been setup to run the Gauge Specs from this project.

# Concepts covered

- Use [Webdriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) as base of implementation
- [Concepts](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/specifications/concepts.html)
- [Specification](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/specifications/index.html), [Scenario](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/specifications/scenarios.html) & [Step](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/specifications/steps.html) usage
- [Table driven execution](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/execution/table_driven_execution.html)
- [External datasource (special param)](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/specifications/parameters.html#special-parameters)

# Prerequisites
- [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). [Required to bring up the [SUT](#setting-up-the-system-under-test-sut)
- [Install Gauge](http://getgauge.io/download.html)
  - Homebrew on Mac OS X :  
      ```
      brew install gauge
      ```
  - [Download Installer](http://getgauge.io/download.html)
- [Install Gauge-Ruby plugin](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/plugins/installation.html) by running<br>
  ```

  ```
- Chromedriver, for Capybara to interact with Chrome. Make sure that the [Chrome driver executable](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) is available in your PATH.

## Setting up the System Under Test (SUT)

* Download [activeadmin-demo.war](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/gauge/activeadmin-demo/activeadmin-demo.war)
* Bring up the SUT by executing the below command
```
java -jar activeadmin-demo.war
```
* The SUT should now be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080)
